# AI Development Transcript: Trial Class Booking System

**Candidate:** Mohit Tiwari
**Project:** Trial Class Appointment Booking System (Codeyoung Full-Stack Engineer assignment)
**Stack:** React (Vite) + Tailwind, Node.js + Express, MongoDB (Mongoose), Luxon, Zod, Nodemailer

## About this file

This project was built over several AI sessions. This file contains:

| Part | Tool | What it was used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | ChatGPT | Architecture, time-zone and DST design, mentor capacity and concurrency design, edge cases, the classroom link and email fixes, README and transcript advice |
| B | Claude | Front-end redesign (Codeyoung-style colours and layout), the built-in demo classroom, planning, set-up help and troubleshooting (for example a MongoDB Atlas login error) |
| C | Claude | A final review of the finished project against the assignment, and what changed as a result |
| D | None | Verification results from actually running the project |
| E | Claude | I found a duplicate booking i fix it|

**How to read Parts A and B.** The text is copied from the chats, unedited, except for three things I did on purpose:
- Real credentials were replaced with `[REDACTED]`.
- Short notes in square brackets (`[ME]`, `[CHATGPT]`, `[GAP: ...]`, `[REMOVED: ...]`) were added by me. The `[ME]` and `[CHATGPT]` labels show who wrote each message; I worked them out from the surrounding text because the copy did not keep speaker names.
- One short stretch of unrelated programming-practice questions from the same ChatGPT chat was removed, and that is marked.


**Where a reply contains a summary or a "reconstructed" transcript** (for example ChatGPT's draft of a transcript in Part A), that text was written by the AI. It is not a record of what was said, and the AI said so itself in the chat.

## Part A: ChatGPT session (design, backend, edge cases, classroom link)

````text
[CHATGPT]
Yes. This assignment is much more than “make a booking form.” The evaluator is explicitly looking at product thinking + edge cases + architecture + code quality + how you use AI.

[ME]
I researched Codeyoung's current public flow as well. Their site currently describes the journey as select a course → book a free trial → enroll if the trial goes well, and their public material describes the trial as a live 1:1 session with a mentor. Their current material also says the booking provides a video-call link and that the trial is free.
[CHATGPT]
Here is the system I would build for your assignment.

1. What exactly are we building?

Think of your application as:

Trial Class Appointment Booking System

There are three main actors:

                 ┌─────────────────────┐
                 │       PARENT        │
                 │ Select date/time    │
                 │ Enter details       │
                 └──────────┬──────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                 ┌─────────────────────┐
                 │   BOOKING SYSTEM    │
                 │                     │
                 │ Timezone conversion │
                 │ Availability check  │
                 │ Mentor assignment   │
                 │ Conflict prevention │
                 └──────────┬──────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                 ┌─────────────────────┐
                 │       MENTOR        │
                 │ Max 2 trials/day    │
                 │ Local India time    │
                 └─────────────────────┘

And after successful booking:

Parent ────────┐
               ├── Confirmation
               ├── Local date/time
               └── Demo class link
               
Mentor ────────┐
               ├── Confirmation
               ├── Local date/time
               └── Demo class link
2. Your tech stack
[ME]
Im already comfortable with MERN, I'd use:

Frontend
React
Vite
Tailwind CSS
React Router
Axios
React Hook Form
Zod
Backend
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Mongoose
Important libraries
luxon

for timezone and DST handling.

Potentially:

nodemailer

for dummy email sending/logging.

for generating demo links.

3. Most important part: TIMEZONE

This is probably one of the most important evaluation points.

Don't do this:

date: "10/10/2026"
time: "10:00 AM"
timezone: "IST"

Instead, store the actual appointment in UTC.

For example:

Parent is in New York.

Parent chooses:

October 10
10:00 AM
America/New_York

Backend converts it to UTC.

Suppose:

UTC:
14:00

Mentor is in India:

Asia/Kolkata

Mentor sees:

October 10
7:30 PM IST

Parent sees:

October 10
10:00 AM EDT

Same appointment.

4. NEVER store timezone as "EST"

This is important.

Don't store:

EST
IST
PST
GMT

Store IANA timezone names:

America/New_York
Europe/London
Asia/Kolkata

Why?

Because of Daylight Saving Time.

For example:

America/New_York

can automatically switch between:

EST
EDT

Your application should not manually calculate that.

Use Luxon
[ME] how to import it provide me syntax:

import { DateTime } from "luxon";

const parentTime = DateTime.fromISO(
    "2026-10-10T10:00",
    {
        zone: "America/New_York"
    }
);

const utcTime = parentTime.toUTC();

const mentorTime = utcTime.setZone("Asia/Kolkata");

Now the library handles DST.

[CHATGPT] Database design

I recommend three main collections.

Mentor
{
    _id,
    name,
    email,
    timezone: "Asia/Kolkata",
    active: true,
    maxDailyTrials: 2
}

You need exactly 10 mentors initially.

Example:

Mentor 1
Mentor 2
Mentor 3
...
Mentor 10
6. Parent collection
{
    _id,
    name,
    email,
    timezone,
    country,
    childName,
    childAge,
    createdAt
}

You can ask:

Parent Name
Email
Child Name
Child Age
Timezone

Don't ask for unnecessary information.

That's part of good UX.

7. Booking collection

This is the most important collection.

{
    _id,

    parentId,
    mentorId,

    startTimeUTC,
    endTimeUTC,

    parentTimezone,
    mentorTimezone,

    status: "CONFIRMED",

    meetingLink,

    createdAt
}

For example:

{
    parentId: "...",
    mentorId: "...",

    startTimeUTC: "2026-10-10T14:00:00Z",
    endTimeUTC: "2026-10-10T14:45:00Z",

    parentTimezone: "America/New_York",
    mentorTimezone: "Asia/Kolkata",

    status: "CONFIRMED",

    meetingLink: "https://demo.codeyoung.local/class/abc123"
}
8. Booking flow



Step 1

Parent opens website.

Landing page:

Book a Free Trial Class

Live 1:1 learning
with an expert mentor

[Book Trial Class]
9. Step 2 — Parent details

Form:

Parent Name
Email
Child Name
Child Age
Country
Timezone


Choose a date

Mon 12
Tue 13
Wed 14
Thu 15
Fri 16

Don't expose backend UTC values.

Everything shown to parent should be their local time.

11. Step 4 — Show available slots

For example:

Saturday, October 10

Available times

10:00 AM
10:30 AM
11:00 AM
11:30 AM

          [Continue]

These are parent-local times.

12. How do we calculate available slots?

This is where your backend becomes interesting.

Suppose:

10 mentors

Each mentor:

maximum 2 trial classes/day

Therefore:

10 × 2 = 20 mentor trial capacity/day

And the assignment says:

20 parents/day

So theoretically:

20 bookings/day

can be accommodated.

But don't simply say:

20 bookings available

You need to check actual mentor/time conflicts.

13. Mentor availability algorithm

Suppose parent wants:

October 10
10:00 AM
America/New_York

Convert:

10:00 AM New York

to UTC.

Then for each mentor:

Mentor 1
Mentor 2
Mentor 3
...
Mentor 10

check:

Is mentor active?
Does mentor already have overlapping booking?
Has mentor reached 2 trials that day?

If yes:

skip mentor

If no:

mentor is available
14. Important: overlapping booking

Suppose mentor has:

10:00 - 10:45

Parent requests:

10:30 - 11:15

Can't assign.

Use overlap logic:

existing.start < requested.end &&
existing.end > requested.start

If true:

OVERLAP
15. Exact boundary case

Suppose:

Existing:
10:00 - 10:45

New booking:

10:45 - 11:30

These don't overlap.

Because:

existing.end === requested.start

So same mentor can be used.

This is an important edge case to test.

16. But mentor daily limit creates another problem

Suppose Mentor 1 has:

10:00 AM
3:00 PM

That's:

2 classes

So they cannot receive:

another class

that same mentor day.

17. What does "day" mean?

This is a good design decision.

The requirement says:

Mentors have at most 2 demo classes a day.

Since mentors are in India, define their working day according to:

Asia/Kolkata

For each mentor:

booking.startTimeUTC
    .setZone(mentor.timezone)
    .toISODate()

Then count bookings for that local date.

This is much safer than using UTC date.

18. Mentor assignment strategy

Don't randomly assign.

Use something like:

Least-loaded mentor
Mentor 1 → 0 bookings
Mentor 2 → 1 booking
Mentor 3 → 2 bookings
...

Choose an available mentor with the lowest number of bookings.

This balances workload.

Example:

Parent requests 10 AM

M1 → available, 0 bookings
M2 → available, 1 booking
M3 → unavailable
M4 → available, 0 bookings

Choose:

M1 or M4

You can use deterministic ordering by mentor ID if tied.

19. Booking API

Your backend could have:

POST /api/bookings/availability

Request:

{
  "date": "2026-10-10",
  "timezone": "America/New_York"
}

Choose your preferred date

< October 2026 >

Mon   Tue   Wed   Thu   Fri
 5     6     7     8     9

Selected:
Saturday, October 10

Available times

11:30 AM       12:15 PM

Times shown in:
Eastern Time (EDT)
36. Booking summary

Before final submission:

Review your booking

Mentor time

Duration
45 minutes

Mentor
Rahul Sharma

                 [Confirm Booking]

This is excellent for avoiding accidental bookings.

37. Admin dashboard — optional but VERY useful

The assignment doesn't explicitly require an admin panel.

But I would build a small internal dashboard.

Not a huge one.

Show:

Today's Overview

Total bookings       12
Available capacity    8
Mentors active        10

Then:

Mentor                Bookings

Rahul                    2
Priya                     1
Amit                      2
Sneha                     0
...

And booking table:

Parent      Mentor      Parent Time     Mentor Time
John        Rahul       10:00 AM        7:30 PM
Sarah       Priya       11:00 AM        8:30 PM

This makes the system much easier to demonstrate to the interviewer.

38. Don't overbuild

This is VERY important.

The assignment says:

A good part of this evaluation is what you do & don't build.

So don't build:

Payment gateway
Real Zoom integration
Chat system
Full authentication
AI chatbot
Complex CMS
Mobile app
Subscription system

These aren't necessary.

Instead, build the core booking experience really well.

39. What I would prioritize
Must have
✓ React frontend
✓ Node/Express backend
✓ MongoDB
✓ 10 mentors
✓ Parent booking
✓ Date selection
✓ Time slots
✓ Mentor assignment
✓ Max 2 classes/mentor/day
✓ Conflict prevention
✓ Timezone conversion
✓ DST handling
✓ UTC storage
✓ Local time display
✓ Dummy meeting link
✓ Confirmation page
✓ Good error states
✓ README
✓ TRANSCRIPT.md
Nice to have
✓ Admin dashboard
✓ Notification simulator
✓ Booking cancellation
✓ Rescheduling
✓ Alternative slots
✓ Unit tests
✓ API tests
40. Testing scenarios

This is where you can impress the evaluator.

Create tests for:

Test 1
Parent timezone: America/New_York
Mentor timezone: Asia/Kolkata

Verify both see correct local time.

Test 2 — UK
Europe/London

Test around DST.

Test 3

Mentor has:

0 bookings

Booking succeeds.

Test 4

Mentor has:

1 booking

Second booking succeeds.

Test 5

Mentor has:

2 bookings

Third booking isn't allowed.

Test 6

Overlap:

10:00–10:45
10:30–11:15

Second booking rejected for that mentor.

Test 7

Back-to-back:

10:00–10:45
10:45–11:30

Allowed.

Test 8

All mentors unavailable.

Expected:

No mentors available.
Please choose another time.
Test 9

20 bookings.

The system should not assign an additional booking when daily capacity is exhausted.

Test 10 — race condition

Two users attempt the same slot simultaneously.

Only one should consume the same mentor/slot capacity.

I used ChatGPT.

Instead, document your AI workflow.

Example structure:

# AI Development Transcript

## Prompt 1 — System Architecture

### My Prompt
dont you think there is holeloop i book appoitment for same student 3 times with same details at same times it allow me to bbok


### AI Response
You found a real hole. The only protection was per mentor, so the same child could book the same time three times and each booking got a different mentor. I've fixed it, but I haven't been able to test the fix.

What the fix does
- A booking is now a duplicate if the same parent email and child name already have a booking at that start time.
- The comparison ignores capitalisation and extra spaces, so Dup@x.com / "Asha  Rao" matches dup@x.com / "asha rao".
- A repeat attempt gets a 409 DUPLICATE_BOOKING response with this message: "This child already has a trial class booked at that time…". The booking form already shows that message.
- It also holds when someone double-clicks or submits several times at once. A unique database index (childKey + startMs) allows only one booking, and the extra attempts give back their mentor's daily seat.

To apply it
1. Copy models.js and bookingService.js into server\src, and booking.test.js into server\test.
2. Restart npm start. MongoDB builds the new index on startup, so the first run may take a moment.
3. Try booking the same child at the same slot twice. The second attempt should be refused.

Testing: my sandbox couldn't download the in-memory MongoDB, so the two new duplicate tests and the updated existing tests haven't been run. Please run npm test in server and tell me what it prints. I also changed the old tests to use a different child for each booking, because they previously reused one parent and child and would now be refused as duplicates.

Still allowed: the same child can book two different time slots, or the same slot with a different child name. If a trial class should be one per child ever, I can change the rule to block any second booking for that child. Tell me if you want that.



## Prompt 2 — Timezone Design

### My Prompt
Why UTC?

### AI Response
It’s one unambiguous moment. Local times are derived from it and can’t drift.

### My Decision

I decided to store appointment timestamps in UTC...

"How did you handle DST?"

###AI

"I don't manually calculate timezone offsets. I use IANA timezone identifiers such as America/New_York and Europe/London through Luxon. That allows the timezone library to apply the correct DST rules for the selected date."

That's a strong answer.

###ME "How do you enforce two classes per mentor?"

###AI

"When assigning a mentor, I calculate the mentor's local calendar date using the mentor's timezone and count their confirmed trial bookings for that local date. A mentor is eligible only if that count is below two."

###ME "What happens if two parents book simultaneously?"

###AI

"Availability shown on the frontend is only advisory. The backend performs the final availability and conflict check during booking, and the database operation is protected against concurrent bookings so the same capacity cannot be consumed twice."

###ME "Why didn't you integrate Zoom?"

###AI

"The assignment explicitly allows a dummy link, so I kept the integration boundary separate. The booking service generates a meeting URL, and a real provider such as Zoom or Google Meet could later replace that implementation without changing the booking flow."

Excellent architecture answer.

46. Your final system architecture

                  Confirmation Emails


The strongest parts of your submission should be:

1. Correct timezone/DST handling
2. Reliable mentor availability/assignment
3. Prevention of double booking
4. Excellent parent UX
5. Clear architecture
6. Good error/edge-case handling
7. Clean README + genuine AI transcript

[ME]
PLEASE CHECK MY EDGE CASES GIVEN TO YOU:

[CHATGPT]
Yes. The edge cases from the original Codeyoung assignment are part of the requirement, and I would keep them in the final version.

The important ones are:

10 mentors maximum, with each mentor limited to 2 demo classes/day.
20 parents/day capacity overall.
Concurrent bookings: two parents trying to take the same slot cannot both get the same mentor/slot.
No mentor available: show a proper user-friendly error instead of a broken/blank page.
Past slots: cannot book.
Minimum lead time: booking too close to the current time is rejected.
Mentor working hours: slots outside the configured working window are unavailable.
Timezone differences: parent and mentor can be in different timezones.
DST: UK/US daylight-saving changes must not shift the actual class time incorrectly.
UTC storage: booking timestamps are stored consistently and converted for display.
Double-click/repeated booking: backend protects against duplicate reservations.
Database race conditions: atomic daily mentor counters and unique constraints prevent overbooking.
Booking failure/rollback: if part of a booking fails, capacity isn't incorrectly consumed.
Email failure: booking logic should not silently create an inconsistent reservation because email delivery has an issue.
Invalid timezone/date/slot input: backend validates it rather than trusting the frontend.
Invalid parent/child information: validation before booking.
Confirmation link: the Join Demo Class button opens the demo classroom correctly.
Calendar/ICS: generated event uses the correct timezone/time.
Responsive UI: booking and classroom should remain usable on desktop/mobile.

And importantly, the final UX we agreed on is:

Booking → Confirmation → JOIN DEMO CLASS → Demo Classroom

No demo-link entry screen.

[ME]

Yes. Replace your entire Success.jsx with this updated version. It keeps your existing design and fixes the Join demo class and Copy link URL.

Now do only these 3 things

1. Save the file (Ctrl + S)

2. Restart frontend:

Ctrl + C
npm run dev

3. Make a completely new booking.

Then click:

You're booked! → Join demo class

It should now open something like:

http://localhost:5173/#/class/49e0aaff-c3a9-4f84-86ce-d4c75b825f4f?mentor=...

instead of:

https://class.codeyoung.example/trial/...

This fixes the frontend button and Copy link. After you confirm this works, we should fix the email link too, because the backend may still be sending the old class.codeyoung.example URL.

Candidate: Mohit Tiwari
Project: Trial Class Appointment Booking System
AI Tool: ChatGPT
Technology Stack: React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

1. Understanding the Assignment

My prompt:

I need to build a trial-class appointment booking system for the Codeyoung Full-Stack Engineer assignment. There are 10 mentors and approximately 20 parents interested in booking trial classes each day.

The application should have a React frontend and a Node.js backend. Parents and mentors may be located in different time zones, including India, the UK, and the US.

The system must handle daylight saving time, prevent mentors from receiving more than two demo classes per day, send a dummy classroom link to both the parent and mentor, and display a proper error message when no mentor is available.

Help me design and implement a complete, reliable solution with a clear README and test coverage.

How I used the response:

I used the assignment requirements to define the main application flow, backend responsibilities, data model, scheduling rules, and frontend experience before focusing on individual implementation details.

2. Scheduling and Time-Zone Requirements

My prompt:

Design the scheduling logic so that parents can view available slots in their own time zone while mentors have their own working hours. Explain how the application should store booking times and handle conversions between time zones.

Refinement:

Do not rely on manually adding or subtracting a fixed number of hours. The implementation should use proper time-zone identifiers and account for daylight saving time changes.

Implementation decisions:

Use IANA time-zone identifiers, such as Asia/Kolkata, Europe/London, and America/New_York.
Store booking start and end times as UTC timestamps.
Convert UTC timestamps into the parent's and mentor's local time zones for display.
Use a time-zone-aware library to calculate local dates and working hours.
Validate that a requested slot is in the future, satisfies the required booking lead time, and falls within the mentor's working hours.
3. Mentor Capacity and Concurrent Bookings

My prompt:

A mentor must receive no more than two demo classes per local calendar day. Please make sure the backend enforces this rule, even if multiple parents attempt to book at the same time.

Additional edge cases I asked to consider:

More than 20 parents attempt to book on the same day.
Multiple parents request the same slot simultaneously.
Multiple requests attempt to use the same mentor's remaining daily capacity.
A booking fails after the capacity has been reserved.
Two requests attempt to create conflicting bookings.

Implementation decisions:

Enforce capacity in the backend rather than relying on frontend availability.
Use MongoDB atomic updates for daily capacity reservations.
Use database uniqueness constraints to prevent duplicate mentor-slot bookings and duplicate mentor-day counter records.
Release a reserved capacity count if booking creation fails.
Return a clear NO_MENTOR_AVAILABLE error when no eligible mentor can accept the booking.
4. Edge-Case Verification

My prompt:

Review the scheduling implementation against the assignment's edge cases. Do not assume the system works just because a booking succeeds once. Check capacity limits, concurrent requests, unavailable slots, invalid dates, and daylight saving time behavior.

Tests included in the project:

Scenario	Expected result
21st booking when daily demand exceeds the 20 available daily demo classes	Booking rejected when all 20 daily capacities are occupied
11 concurrent requests for the same slot with 10 eligible mentors	At most 10 successful bookings for that slot
30 concurrent requests across available slots	At most 20 successful bookings, with no mentor exceeding two classes per local day
Booking a past time	Rejected
Booking outside mentor working hours	Rejected
Requesting availability after bookings are made	Previously occupied slots are no longer available
UK, US, and India time-zone conversions	Displayed times correspond to the requested time zone and date
No eligible mentor remains	A meaningful no-availability response is returned

Verification approach:

The project includes automated tests for the scheduling rules and concurrency scenarios. These tests are intended to verify the expected outcomes rather than relying on manual inspection alone.

The test cases should be run in the configured test environment before claiming that the full suite passes.

5. Frontend Booking Experience

My prompt:

Build a clean and responsive booking interface. The user should be able to select a time zone, choose a date, view available slots, enter parent and child details, and confirm a booking.

My refinement:

After booking, show a confirmation page first. Do not make the user enter a demo-class link on a separate page before booking. The confirmation page should contain a “Join demo class” button that opens the built-in demo classroom.

Expected user flow:

Open the booking interface.
Select a date and time zone.
Choose an available slot.
Enter parent and child details.
Submit the booking.
View the confirmation page with the selected mentor and local booking times.
Click “Join demo class” to enter the built-in classroom.

The confirmation page also provides calendar actions and a copy-link option.

6. Classroom Link and Email Integration

My prompt:

Generate a dummy classroom link that works with the application's own frontend. The parent and mentor should receive the same classroom link in their confirmation emails.

Edge cases considered:

The classroom URL should not point to a nonexistent placeholder domain.
The Join button and Copy link action should use the intended classroom URL.
The backend response and email content should use a consistent meeting link.
The classroom route should contain enough information to identify the booking.
Email credentials must be supplied through environment variables rather than committed to the repository.

Issue discovered during manual testing:

The Join demo class button initially opened a URL under class.codeyoung.example, which failed to resolve in the browser.

My follow-up prompt:

The button still opens the old placeholder URL. Help me fix the link so it opens the built-in classroom in my running application.

Resolution approach:

I traced the link through the booking API response and the frontend confirmation component. The frontend was using the link returned by the backend. I then updated the confirmation component to construct the classroom route using the current frontend origin and the booking details.

Important verification still required:

The backend-generated link and both email links must also be checked. A frontend-only correction does not prove that the backend and emails are using the same URL. For a deployed application, the configured application URL must point to the actual frontend deployment.

[NOTE from me, added after the chat: the submitted code does not build the link in `Success.jsx` from `window.location.origin` as described above. The backend generates the classroom link (from `APP_URL`) and returns it, and the confirmation page, the calendar links and both emails all use that same link. The README describes this.]

7. API Validation and Error Handling

My prompt:

Validate incoming booking data on the server and return useful errors for invalid input, unavailable slots, and scheduling conflicts. The frontend should display understandable messages rather than exposing internal server errors.

Implementation decisions:

Validate request data using a schema.
Validate time-zone identifiers.
Validate parent and child details.
Reject invalid or unavailable booking times.
Return structured error responses for known booking failures.
Keep server-side capacity and availability checks authoritative.
8. Configuration and Security

My prompt:

Make the project straightforward to run locally and prepare it for repository submission. Keep database credentials and email passwords out of the source code.

Implementation decisions:

Provide an .env.example file containing placeholder configuration values.
Read database and SMTP configuration from environment variables.
Exclude .env, dependency directories, and build output from version control.
Document backend and frontend installation and startup commands.
Provide an optional email-testing fallback when real SMTP credentials are not configured.

Real passwords, API keys, and private connection strings should never be added to TRANSCRIPT.md or committed to GitHub.

9. Final Review and Testing

My prompt:

Review the final project against the original assignment. Check the booking flow, time-zone handling, mentor capacity limits, error states, classroom navigation, email configuration, and setup instructions. Identify any issues that still require manual verification.

Review checklist:

Booking interface loads successfully.

Parent and child details are validated.

Available slots update after successful bookings.

Past and out-of-hours bookings are rejected.

No mentor receives more than two demo classes per local calendar day.

Concurrent booking tests pass.

Time-zone conversions and daylight saving time cases are tested.

No-mentor availability errors are handled correctly.

The confirmation page appears immediately after a successful booking.

Join demo class opens the built-in classroom.

Copy link produces the intended classroom URL.

Parent and mentor emails use the correct classroom link.

README setup instructions work in a clean environment.

No secrets are committed to the repository.

Testing note: Source-level checks and test definitions are not equivalent to a complete successful test run. Record the actual results from running the project and automated tests before submission.

10. Final Outcome

I used AI as a development assistant to help interpret the requirements, structure the implementation, identify edge cases, improve the booking flow, and review the code.

The final goal is a maintainable trial-class booking application with time-zone-aware scheduling, concurrency-safe mentor capacity enforcement, clear error states, a working confirmation-to-classroom flow, and documented setup and testing procedures.

The submitted repository should contain the application source code, README, environment example, automated tests, and this transcript. All claims about completed features and test results should reflect the actual state of the submitted code.


My prompt:

The Join demo class button still opens https://class.codeyoung.example/trial/... and the browser shows DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN. What should I do? 

ChatGPT's reply:

No problem. You don't need to understand the technical part. The problem is simply that your project is still using an old fake URL.

Open client/src/components/Success.jsx. Find the anchor using href={done.link} and change it to use a classroom URL generated from the current frontend origin and the booking details.

Update the Copy link action to copy that same URL. Save the file, restart the frontend, and make a new booking to test the change.

This fixes the frontend button and Copy link action. The backend and email links must also be checked separately to ensure they use the correct classroom URL.

Exchange 2: Updating Success.jsx

My prompt:

Here is my current Success.jsx. 

ChatGPT's reply:

Replace your entire Success.jsx with the updated version. It keeps your existing design and fixes the Join demo class and Copy link URL.

The updated component generates the classroom URL using window.location.origin, done.id, done.mentorName, and done.startUtc. It then uses that URL for both the Join demo class button and the Copy link action.

Save the file, restart the frontend, and create a new booking to test the updated link.

This corrects the frontend navigation. The backend-generated URL and the links sent in parent and mentor emails still need to be verified.

Exchange 3: Improving the AI Transcript

My prompt:

My TRANSCRIPT.md needs responses between you and me. I need a better version. Give me good prompts that include the edge cases I provided and the verification process.

ChatGPT's reply:

The transcript should show the prompts used to develop the application, the edge cases considered, the implementation decisions, and the verification approach.

It should cover time-zone conversion, daylight saving time, mentor capacity, concurrent bookings, invalid booking requests, frontend navigation, email integration, environment configuration, and testing.



## Part B: Claude session (front end, demo classroom, extras, set-up)

````text
i want to enchance ui/frontend please give me that file backend is done but now i need to enchance frontend

Shared a file, ran a command
The new frontend already covers the task requirements, and I’ve updated the zip with a README section on the frontend decisions.

How the UI maps to the task

Local times everywhere (req 1 and 2): slots show in the parent’s auto-detected zone with an abbreviation (EDT, BST, IST). The confirmation screen shows the parent’s time and the mentor’s IST time. DST is handled by the backend through Luxon and IANA zones.
Dummy link (req 3): the Join button, Google Calendar, .ics download and copy-link all use the booking’s link.
No mentors available (req 5):
A full day shows a clear message and a one-click jump to the next day with openings.
A slot taken mid-booking shows a warning and a refreshed grid.



Codeyoung frontend

there is domo link which show This site can’t be reached
class.codeyoung.example’s DNS address could not be found. Diagnosing the problem.

Try running Windows Network Diagnostics.
DNS_PROBE_STARTED i want if to show anything good demo

Shared a file, ran 3 commands
The demo link now opens a working demo classroom inside your own app instead of the dead class.codeyoung.example address. I only confirmed that the client builds; I haven’t clicked through the classroom in a browser. The updated client/ folder is in the zip above, frontend only.

The classroom, which opens from the confirmation screen’s “Join demo class” button, has:

A short “Joining your trial class…” screen while the mentor “joins”.
A mentor video tile showing their name, and your own tile with mic, camera, raise-hand and Leave buttons.
A “live” badge and a timer counting up to 30:00.
A code editor where a small spiral program types itself out, as if the mentor were sharing it.
A class chat where the mentor sends a few welcome messages and you can type your own.
A “Thanks for joining!” screen after Leave, with a button back to booking.
The same link is used for Google Calendar, the .ics file and Copy link.

Emails still carry the old link. Those come from the backend, which I left alone. To fix it, change this one line in server/src/bookingService.js (line 83):

js
meetingLink: `${process.env.CLIENT_URL || 'http://localhost:5173'}/#/class/${id}`,
The classroom page reads the mentor name from the link, so emailed links would show a generic “Your mentor” until you add ?mentor=... to that line as well. The link on the confirmation screen already includes it. The emailed links also work only while your frontend is running.

PS C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\codeyoung\codeyoung-trial-booking\server

This error means MongoDB Atlas rejected the username or password in your MONGODB_URI. The server reached Atlas fine, so the problem is the credentials. These are the usual causes, in order of likelihood:

Wrong user type. The username and password must belong to a Database User, not your Atlas login. In Atlas, go to Security → Database Access.
Wrong or forgotten password. On that page, click Edit on your user, choose Edit Password, and set a new one. Use only letters and numbers to avoid the next problem. Click Update User and wait about a minute.
Special characters in the password. Characters like @ : / ? # % break the URI and must be URL-encoded (@ becomes %40). A simple alphanumeric password avoids this.
Angle brackets left in. Atlas shows mongodb+srv://user:<password>@cluster.... Replace <password> including the < and >.
Wrong Atlas username. Copy it exactly as shown in Database Access.
Fix it
In Atlas, click Connect → Drivers on your cluster and copy the connection string.
Put it in server/.env with your values and the database name added before the ?:
env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/codeyoung_trials?retryWrites=true&w=majority
Don’t add quotes or spaces around the value.
Make sure the file is named .env, not .env.txt (Windows hides extensions).
The file is server/.env, not the project root.
Save, then run npm start again.

If the error changes to a timeout or ECONNREFUSED, go to Security → Network Access in Atlas and add your current IP. For testing, you can allow 0.0.0.0/0.

If it still fails, paste your MONGODB_URI with the password replaced by xxxx and I’ll spot the problem.


## Part C: Claude final review

I gave Claude the finished project (a zip) together with the assignment text and asked whether it was complete. The review compared the code with the assignment and with the README.

**What the review found and what changed**

- Time-zone and DST handling, the 2-classes-per-mentor-per-day cap, and the double-booking protection were confirmed by reading the code and tests.
- An earlier summary transcript and the README described a "Demo Link Setup" screen that does not exist in the code. The README was corrected and the claim removed.
- `.env.example` had Gmail SMTP switched on with placeholder credentials, which would make emails fail silently. The SMTP lines are now commented out, so the Ethereal test inbox is the default.
- Basic per-IP rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`) was added to the slots and booking endpoints, with tests for the 429 response.
- The README gained an architecture section explaining how the 2-per-day cap and double-booking prevention work, and an honest "Not production-ready" list.
- Booking lookup and cancel/reschedule were deliberately left out of the submitted version, and the README says so.
- Added after this review, in the later session in Part E: a guard against the same parent and child booking the same slot twice (a unique database index plus a clear `DUPLICATE_BOOKING` error), and a front-end redesign.
